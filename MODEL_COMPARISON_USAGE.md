# Model Comparison Feature - Usage Guide

The model comparison feature in Pioneer.jl automatically tests three different machine learning approaches for PSM scoring and selects the best performing one based on validation performance.

## Overview

When enabled, the system performs an 80/20 train-validation split and tests:

1. **SimpleXGBoost** - Conservative XGBoost with reduced hyperparameters
2. **ProbitRegression** - Linear probit model with cross-validation  
3. **SuperSimplified** - XGBoost with minimal feature set (5 features)

The best model is selected based on the number of targets passing q-value ≤ 0.01 threshold on the validation set, with tie-breaking by AUC and training time.

## Configuration

Add these parameters to the `machine_learning` section of your JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "optimization": {
    "machine_learning": {
      "enable_model_comparison": true,
      "validation_split_ratio": 0.2,
      "qvalue_threshold": 0.01,
      "min_psms_for_comparison": 1000,
      "max_psms_for_comparison": 100000
    }
  }
}
```

### Parameters

- **enable_model_comparison** (boolean): Enable/disable model comparison (default: false)
- **validation_split_ratio** (float): Fraction of data for validation (default: 0.2)
- **qvalue_threshold** (float): Q-value threshold for target counting (default: 0.01)
- **min_psms_for_comparison** (int): Minimum PSMs required for comparison (default: 1000)
- **max_psms_for_comparison** (int): Maximum PSMs for in-memory comparison (default: 100000)

## When Model Comparison is Used

Model comparison is automatically enabled when:
- `enable_model_comparison` is set to `true`
- PSM count is between `min_psms_for_comparison` and `max_psms_for_comparison`
- Using in-memory scoring approach (< 100k PSMs by default)

## Output

When model comparison runs, you'll see:

1. **Console Logging**: Detailed progress and results for each model
2. **model_comparison_report.csv**: Performance metrics table
3. **Enhanced Log Files**: Model selection rationale and performance

## Model Configurations

### SimpleXGBoost
- **Features**: ~35 comprehensive features (spectral, RT, MS1, MBR if enabled)
- **Hyperparameters**: Conservative settings optimized for small-medium datasets
- **Use Case**: General purpose, good balance of performance and stability

### ProbitRegression  
- **Features**: Same as SimpleXGBoost but linear combination
- **Algorithm**: Cross-validation probit regression
- **Use Case**: When interpretability is important or XGBoost fails

### SuperSimplified
- **Features**: Only 5 core features (spectral contrast, residuals, intensity)
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost with minimal feature set
- **Use Case**: Very small datasets or when feature availability is limited

## Fallback Behavior

The system automatically falls back to the standard approach when:
- Model comparison is disabled
- PSM count is outside the specified range
- All models fail to train
- Any critical error occurs during comparison

## Integration Testing

Run the integration test to verify the feature works:

```bash
julia --project=dev test_model_comparison_integration.jl
```

Or test with the E. coli dataset directly:

```bash
julia --project=dev -e "using Pioneer; SearchDIA(\"./data/ecoli_test/ecoli_test_params_model_comparison.json\")"
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: Model comparison requires ~1.5x memory of standard approach
- **Runtime**: Adds ~2x training time (3 models vs 1)
- **Accuracy**: Typically improves target identification by 5-15%
- **Robustness**: Provides fallback when primary approach fails

## Best Practices

1. **Enable for medium datasets** (1k-100k PSMs) where performance gains are most significant
2. **Use 80/20 split** for sufficient validation data
3. **Monitor logs** to understand which model performs best for your data
4. **Compare results** with standard approach to validate improvements
5. **Disable for very large datasets** (>100k PSMs) to avoid memory issues

## Troubleshooting

### Model comparison disabled messages
- Check PSM count is within specified range
- Verify `enable_model_comparison` is `true`
- Ensure using in-memory approach

### All models fail to train
- Check feature availability in your data
- Verify sufficient target/decoy PSMs
- Review logs for specific error messages

### Poor model performance
- Consider adjusting `qvalue_threshold`
- Check data quality and preprocessing
- Verify cross-validation fold assignment
