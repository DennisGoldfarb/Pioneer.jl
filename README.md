# Aims
  Titus aims to simplify from of survey analysis that characterize internal standard peptides, preparation of data aquisition methods, and analysis of IS-PRM experiments. Peak area ratios are estimated using MM-Estimators which are robust to outliers (from potentially interfered or noisy fragmnet ions). Integration. Summarization of peptide-level to protein-level quantitation is carried out using the MaxLFQ algorithm () without normalization. Titus Generates and high-quality, informative chromatogram plots and the best in multi-page pdf's which are ctrl+f searchable in any standard pdf viewer.
