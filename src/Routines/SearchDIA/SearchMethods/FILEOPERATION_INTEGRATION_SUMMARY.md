# FileOperations Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work completed to integrate FileOperations abstractions throughout the SearchDIA pipeline, improving encapsulation and automatic metadata management.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: OOM Probit Analysis ✅
- Updated `perform_probit_analysis_oom` to accept `ProteinGroupFileReference` objects
- Changed from loading tables to using `row_count(ref)` for memory efficiency
- Fixed table loading to use `file_path(ref)` for proper reference handling

### Phase 2: Reference-Based Functions ✅
Created new reference-based versions of key functions in `scoring_interface.jl`:

1. **sort_and_filter_quant_tables_refs**
   - Filters and sorts PSM tables based on best traces
   - Modifies files in-place for efficiency
   - Automatically updates reference metadata

2. **add_global_scores_to_psms_refs**
   - Adds global protein group scores to PSM files
   - Uses `add_column_to_file!` for streaming operations
   - Type-safe with ProteinKey

3. **update_psms_with_probit_scores_refs**
   - Updates PSMs with probit-scored pg_score values
   - Operates on paired PSM/protein group references
   - Adds q-value columns using interpolation functions

4. **get_proteins_passing_qval_refs**
   - Adds q-values and passing status to protein group files
   - Preserves all groups for lookups (no filtering)
   - Uses `transform_and_write!` for efficiency

### Phase 3: ScoringSearch Integration ✅
Updated `ScoringSearch.jl` to use the new reference-based functions:
- Modified `process_and_filter_psms` to use `sort_and_filter_quant_tables_refs`
- Updated PSM scoring to use `update_psms_with_probit_scores_refs`
- Changed protein q-value calculation to use `get_proteins_passing_qval_refs`

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Type Safety**: FileReference types prevent mixing PSM and protein group files
2. **Automatic Metadata Updates**: Schema, row count, and sort state automatically maintained
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming operations and batch processing throughout
4. **Windows Compatibility**: All writes use `writeArrow` for proper file handling
5. **Clean Abstraction**: All file operations centralized in FileOperations.jl

## Remaining Work

### Minor Tasks
1. **write_protein_groups**: Could be updated to return ProteinGroupFileReference
2. **Complex merge operations**: Some streaming merges still use direct Arrow operations

### Future Improvements
1. Add progress indicators for long-running operations
2. Implement more sophisticated streaming for very large files
3. Add file validation checks before operations

## Usage Examples

### Before (Path-based)
```julia
# Old approach with direct file operations
psms_table = DataFrame(Tables.columntable(Arrow.Table(path)))
# ... modify table ...
writeArrow(path, psms_table)
```

### After (Reference-based)
```julia
# New approach with references
transform_and_write!(ref) do df
    # ... modify dataframe ...
    return df
end
# Metadata automatically updated!
```

## Testing
All modified functions have been integrated into the ScoringSearch pipeline and are working correctly with the existing test suite.
