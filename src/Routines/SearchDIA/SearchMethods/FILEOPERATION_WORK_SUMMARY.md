# FileOperations Integration Work Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive FileOperations integration work completed for the SearchDIA pipeline, which improves encapsulation, type safety, and automatic metadata management throughout the codebase.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Updated `perform_probit_analysis_oom`
- Changed function signature to accept `ProteinGroupFileReference` objects instead of paths
- Improved memory efficiency by using `row_count(ref)` instead of loading entire tables
- Fixed table loading to properly use `file_path(ref)` for reference handling

### 2. Created Reference-Based Functions
Created new reference-based versions of key functions in `scoring_interface.jl`:

#### `sort_and_filter_quant_tables_refs`
- Filters and sorts PSM tables based on best traces
- Modifies files in-place for efficiency
- Automatically updates reference metadata after operations

#### `add_global_scores_to_psms_refs`
- Adds global protein group scores to PSM files
- Uses `add_column_to_file!` for streaming operations
- Type-safe with ProteinKey struct

#### `update_psms_with_probit_scores_refs`
- Updates PSMs with probit-scored pg_score values
- Operates on paired PSM/protein group references
- Adds q-value columns using interpolation functions
- Handles missing data gracefully

#### `get_proteins_passing_qval_refs`
- Adds q-values and passing status to protein group files
- Preserves all groups for lookups (no filtering)
- Uses `transform_and_write!` for efficiency

### 3. Updated ScoringSearch.jl Integration
- Modified `process_and_filter_psms` to use `sort_and_filter_quant_tables_refs`
- Updated PSM scoring to use `update_psms_with_probit_scores_refs`
- Changed protein q-value calculation to use `get_proteins_passing_qval_refs`
- All file operations now go through the reference-based abstraction

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Type Safety**: FileReference types prevent mixing PSM and protein group files
2. **Automatic Metadata Updates**: Schema, row count, and sort state automatically maintained
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming operations and batch processing throughout
4. **Windows Compatibility**: All writes use `writeArrow` for proper file handling
5. **Clean Abstraction**: All file operations centralized in FileOperations.jl
6. **Error Prevention**: Can't accidentally use stale file references
7. **Debugging**: Easier to track file operations and transformations

## Technical Details

### writeArrow Function
All file writes in the FileOperations abstraction use the `writeArrow` function from `src/utils/writeArrow.jl`. This function handles Windows-specific file system issues and ensures consistent Arrow file writing across different operating systems.

### FileReference Type Hierarchy
```
FileReference (abstract)
├── PSMFileReference
└── ProteinGroupFileReference
```

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Transform and Write**: Load, modify, and write back with automatic metadata updates
2. **Streaming Operations**: Process large files in batches to limit memory usage
3. **Reference Immutability**: References track file state but operations return updated references
4. **Type-Safe Operations**: Can't accidentally mix different file types in operations

## Code Examples

### Before (Path-based)
```julia
# Old approach with direct file operations
psms_table = DataFrame(Tables.columntable(Arrow.Table(path)))
# ... modify table ...
writeArrow(path, psms_table)
```

### After (Reference-based)
```julia
# New approach with references
transform_and_write!(ref) do df
    # ... modify dataframe ...
    return df
end
# Metadata automatically updated!
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Progress Indicators**: Add progress bars for long-running operations
2. **Validation**: Add more comprehensive file validation before operations
3. **Caching**: Consider caching frequently accessed metadata
4. **Parallel Operations**: Explore parallel file processing where appropriate

## Integration Status
All modified functions have been integrated into the ScoringSearch pipeline and are working correctly with the existing test suite. The refactoring maintains backward compatibility while providing a cleaner, safer interface for file operations.
