# Implementation Summary: ScoringSearch Reference-Based Abstractions

## What We Fixed Today

### 1. Auto-Sorting in Merge Operations ✅
**Problem**: Files weren't sorted by expected keys, causing merge failures
**Solution**: Modified `stream_sorted_merge` to automatically sort files with warnings
```julia
if !is_sorted_by(ref, sort_keys...)
    @warn "File $i ($(file_path(ref))) is not sorted by $sort_keys. Sorting now..."
    sort_file_by_keys!(ref, sort_keys...; reverse=reverse)
end
```

### 2. Safe File Sorting ✅
**Problem**: Bus error when sorting memory-mapped Arrow files
**Solution**: Use `Tables.columntable` to load data into memory before sorting
```julia
# Load file into memory (not memory-mapped)
df = DataFrame(Tables.columntable(Arrow.Table(file_path(ref))))
```

### 3. Sort Key Consistency ✅
**Problem**: Protein groups sorted by multiple keys, but merge expected single key
**Solution**: Changed `write_protein_groups_arrow` to sort by `:pg_score` only

### 4. Reference-Based Operations ✅
**Problem**: Direct file operations scattered throughout code
**Solution**: Updated key functions to use FileReference abstractions:
- `sort_protein_tables` now uses `sort_file_by_keys!`
- Merge operations use reference-based approach
- File metadata tracked automatically

## Current Architecture

### FileReference Type Hierarchy
```
FileReference (abstract)
├── PSMFileReference
└── ProteinGroupFileReference
```

### Key Operations in FileOperations.jl
- `stream_sorted_merge` - N-key merge with auto-sort
- `sort_file_by_keys!` - Safe in-place sorting
- `apply_protein_inference` - Wrapped protein inference
- `merge_protein_groups_by_score` - Specialized merge

### Integration with ScoringSearch
1. File references created after protein inference
2. Stored in SearchContext for downstream methods
3. MaxLFQSearch retrieves references from SearchContext
4. All merges use reference-based operations

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Protein Group Lookup Mismatch
- Some PSMs reference proteins not in protein group files
- Needs investigation of protein inference logic
- May be related to filtering or edge cases

### 2. Direct File Operations
- Still using `writeArrow` and `Arrow.write` directly
- Should migrate to FileOperations wrappers
- Maintains consistency and enables future changes

### 3. Validation Gaps
- No automated consistency checks
- Missing validation between paired files
- Should add checks after key operations

## Design Principles

1. **Memory Safety**: Only copy to memory when modifying data
2. **Performance**: Keep memory-mapped reads for analysis
3. **Abstraction**: All file operations through FileOperations.jl
4. **Robustness**: Auto-fix issues with warnings rather than failing
5. **Visibility**: Clear warnings when corrections are made

## Next Steps

1. Debug protein group lookup issue
2. Add FileOperations wrappers for all write operations
3. Implement validation functions
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Document the new patterns for future development

## Example Usage

### Before (Direct Operations)
```julia
df = DataFrame(Arrow.Table(path))
sort!(df, :pg_score, rev=true)
Arrow.write(path, df)
```

### After (Reference-Based)
```julia
ref = ProteinGroupFileReference(path)
sort_file_by_keys!(ref, :pg_score; reverse=true)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No more bus errors** from sorting memory-mapped files
2. **Automatic recovery** from unsorted files
3. **Type safety** with file references
4. **Centralized logic** for file operations
5. **Better debugging** with clear warnings and metadata
