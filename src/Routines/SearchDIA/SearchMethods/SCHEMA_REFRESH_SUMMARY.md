# Schema Refresh Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed the error "Sort key global_pg_score not found in file schema" that occurred when trying to sort protein group files after adding new columns.

## Root Cause
The FileReference objects were not automatically updating their schema metadata when columns were added to files. This caused validation to fail when trying to sort by newly added columns.

## Solution Implemented
Implemented Approach 3: All file operations that modify schema go through the FileOperations abstraction layer, which automatically maintains FileReference metadata integrity.

## Key Changes

### 1. New FileOperations Functions
- **`write_arrow_file`**: General-purpose write that updates all metadata
- **`transform_and_write!`**: Load, transform, and write with metadata update
- **`add_column_and_sort!`**: Add column and sort in one operation

### 2. Updated Existing Functions
- All `Arrow.write` calls now use `writeArrow` for Windows compatibility
- `add_column_to_file!` and `update_column_in_file!` handle small files without partitioner issues
- Functions automatically update FileReference schema, row_count, and sorted_by metadata

### 3. Reference-Based Wrappers
- **`calculate_and_add_global_scores!`**: Replaces direct file operations with reference-based approach
- **`apply_probit_scores!`**: Updates protein group files through references
- Uses `ProteinKey` type instead of raw tuples for type safety

### 4. ScoringSearch Integration
- Uses existing references from SearchContext instead of recreating them
- `perform_protein_probit_regression` now accepts references instead of paths
- Direct `writeArrow` calls replaced with FileOperations functions

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Uses `row_count(ref)` instead of loading tables just to count rows
- Small files processed without streaming partitioner to avoid issues
- Maintains memory efficiency for large files

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Automatic Schema Synchronization**: FileReference metadata always matches file state
2. **No Manual Updates Needed**: No need to call refresh_schema! after modifications
3. **Type Safety**: Can't accidentally use stale references or wrong file types
4. **Windows Compatibility**: All writes use writeArrow for proper file handling
5. **Clean Abstraction**: All file operations centralized in FileOperations.jl

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests in `test/UnitTests/test_schema_refresh_simple.jl` that verify:
- Schema updates when columns are added
- Row counts are maintained correctly
- Sort state is tracked properly
- Functions work with both small and large files

## Usage Example
```julia
# References automatically stay synchronized
pg_refs = get_protein_refs(scoring_refs)

# Add global scores - schema automatically updated
acc_to_max_pg_score = calculate_and_add_global_scores!(pg_refs)

# Sort by the new column - no schema error!
for ref in pg_refs
    sort_file_by_keys!(ref, :global_pg_score; reverse=true)
end
```

## Future Improvements
- Update OOM version of perform_probit_analysis to use references
- Convert remaining writeArrow calls in utils.jl to use FileOperations
- Add more comprehensive streaming support for very large files
- Consider adding batch processing progress indicators
