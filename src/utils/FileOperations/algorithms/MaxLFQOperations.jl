"""
MaxLFQ algorithm operations and validation.

This module is reserved for future MaxLFQ-specific file operations.
Currently, MaxLFQ functionality is implemented directly in MaxLFQSearch
which uses MSData and the existing LFQ algorithm from utils/maxLFQ.jl.

# This module is currently empty as the MaxLFQ wrapper functions
# were not being used in the actual search pipeline.
# MaxLFQ functionality is instead handled by:
# - MaxLFQSearch search method which uses MSData directly
# - Existing LFQ algorithm in utils/maxLFQ.jl
# - Pipeline system for data preprocessing
# - Merge operations for combining files

# Future MaxLFQ-specific file operations would go here when needed.
