# NOTE: The original tests in this file were disabled because they test functionality 
# that doesn't match the actual update_psms_with_scores function. 
#
# The function is designed to add protein group scores to PSMs based on protein 
# grouping (using protein_name, target, entrapment_group_id as keys), not for 
# generic PSM score updates by precursor_idx as the original tests assumed.
#
# The correct functionality is tested in test_psm_updates_simple.jl
#
# If you need to test generic PSM score updates by precursor_idx, that would
# require a different function to be implemented.
