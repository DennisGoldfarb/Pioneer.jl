FileOperations Test Suite Runner

This file runs all tests for the modular FileOperations system.
It serves as the entry point for testing the entire FileOperations
functionality in the new modular structure.

Usage:
```julia
include("test/utils/FileOperations/test_file_operations_suite.jl")
```

Test Structure:
- core/: Tests for FileSchema, FileReferences, SortStateManagement
- streaming/: Tests for StreamOperations, ColumnOperations, MergeOperations  
- pipeline/: Tests for PipelineAPI and transformation operations
- algorithms/: Tests for ProteinInference and PSM update algorithms
- io/: Tests for ValidationFunctions and file I/O operations
