Model Comparison Integration Test

This script demonstrates how to use the new model comparison feature in Pioneer.jl.
It runs the E. coli test dataset with model comparison enabled and compares the results
with the standard approach.

Usage:
    julia --project=dev test_model_comparison_integration.jl
